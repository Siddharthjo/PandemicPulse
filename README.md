# PandemicPulse

PandemicPulse is a data analysis project focused on exploring and visualizing COVID-19 pandemic data from various perspectives. The project utilizes Python's data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze global COVID-19 trends, compare country-specific data, and investigate correlations and impacts.

## Project Overview

### Part 1: COVID-19 Data Analysis

**Dataset Loading and Pre-processing**

- Load COVID-19 data using Pandas from a provided URL.
- Handle missing values and convert date columns to date-time format.

**Data Exploration and Cleaning**

- Explore basic dataset information (number of rows, columns, data types).
- Address outliers and inconsistencies in the data.

**Visualize Global Trends**

- Plot trends of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

**Country-Specific Analysis**

- Visualize COVID-19 trends for specific countries.
- Compare trends among multiple countries on the same plot.

**Comparative Analysis**

- Create bar plots to compare total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries among the top 10 affected countries.
- Analyze growth rates using moving averages.

**Correlation Analysis**

- Investigate correlations between different variables (e.g., confirmed cases and deaths).
- Visualize correlation matrices using heatmaps.

### Part 2: Further Data Insights

**Trend Analysis**

- Visualize trends of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries globally over time.

**Country-Specific Insights**

- Identify countries with the highest numbers of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries as of the latest date.

**Comparative Country Analysis**

- Compare trends of confirmed cases among the top 5 most affected countries.

**Global Growth Rate**

- Calculate and visualize the growth rates of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries globally.

**Top 10 Countries Overview**

- Provide cumulative counts of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for the top 10 most affected countries.

**Recovery Rate Comparison**

- Compare recovery rates across different countries.

**Correlation Overview**

- Analyze correlations between confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries globally.

**Lockdown Impact Analysis**

- Investigate how lockdown measures impact the trend of confirmed cases in different countries.

**Testing and Cases**

- Explore the relationship between the number of tests conducted and confirmed cases in various countries.

**Geographical Distribution**

- Visualize the distribution of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries by continent.
